# What is Messaging Layer Security (MLS)?
Messaging Layer Security (MLS) is a security layer for encrypting messages in groups of size two to many. It is being built by the MLS working group and designed to be efficient, practical and secure. MLS is the first standardized and fully specified end-to-end encryption protocol. The specification is freely accessible, and its security has been analyzed in a series of academic publications. [Read more]([url](https://blog.phnx.im/rfc-9420-mls/)).

The protocol has been approved by the IESG and has been published as [RFC9420]([url](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9420/)). There are several [implementations]([url](https://github.com/mlswg/mls-implementations)).
